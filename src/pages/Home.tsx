                              Over the last 7 years, I've managed to grow from an amateur videographer filming weddings of my relatives to an acknowledged professional cooperating with world brands and fashion icons. Coca-Cola, Zadig & Voltaire, Tiffany & Co - these are just a few of those I have worked with.

                              Yet, event videography was embedded in my heart. Seeing and capturing true emotions at the most important people's occasions is what makes me truly love this profession.

                              I always strive to think outside the box. Looking at everyday things from a new perspective helps me find beauty even in the most ordinary things. Browse through my projects to understand what I'm talking about.
